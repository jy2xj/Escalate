One major problem in modern classrooms is that teachers only teach at one pace to a class with students with different levels of previous knowledge and skill. This application was created to ensure that students who are having trouble do not fall behind in classes. To do so, this application assists teachers by allowing them to monitor the progress of each student in their school work to determine which students they should focus their time and resources on in class.

Current Features:
Separate Logins for students and teachers
Students are able to view their quiz grades and compare with the class averages.
Teachers are able to view their entire student class and see their overall progress.

Upcoming Features:
Allow teachers to create activities/assignments inside the application 
Allow students to complete assignments online to determine which sections students are struggling in.
A tutoring subpage that
  Allows students who are behind to request tutoring for the sections they are having trouble with.
  Allows students who are ahead to become tutors for the sections that they excel in.
  Matches high-achieving students and lower-achieving students and allows them to schedule meetup times outside of class.
  Allows the teacher to see who has been matched and when students have scheduled to meet.
